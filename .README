Using the data found on this url https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/pokemon, create a database called assignment 3.

 

Then create a table called pokemon which has:

id - integer - identity field - primary key - not null

description - character varying - 30 long - not null

base_total - integer - not null

 

Add the following records to the table:

Bulbasaur, 318

Ivysaur, 405

Charizard, 634

Venusaur, 625

Squirtle, 314

 

Create a web page that shows all of the data from the table in order of pokemon name. There should also be a form that contains an input allowing the user to enter the name of the pokemon and a submit button. When the button is clicked, the form is sent to a route called searchPokemon. That route will find the character in the table and return the name and the base_total to a new view and display that info.
 

Try to make it look professional.
